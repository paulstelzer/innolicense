# InnoLicense 

InnoLicense is a server-client web application. The Server is based on Nestjs working on Node.js, MySQL and Express with a REST-API. The client is based on Angular 6 and Ionic 4. So the client can be published as PWA working in all modern browsers and as Android and iOS App!

## Features

* Creating a license system: If you sell products and plugins and the user has to activate this via a license number
* Integration with WordPress: You can create WordPress Plugins in the license system and the user can update the plugin if he has an active license number
* Envato Integration: If you sell your WordPress Plugin (or any other product) on codecanyon / themeforest, you can add your item and the user can use his envato license id, he get after purchase at this marketplace
* REST-API: To confirm the license number, the user has to fill in the licensenumber on his website and the server checks. Everything else (login at the license system, creating license numbers etc) is based on REST-API.
* MIT License: InnoLicense is Open Source, can be reused and do whatever you want

## Installation

InnoLicense is based on a server and a client. You find them under /server/ and under /client/ . The client is optional and gives you an GUI to manage licenses, create a new license number, add WordPress Plugins and more. Please read the README.md in both folders to install client and server.
